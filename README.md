# UFOs
## Overview of Project:
This project is to create a dynamic table based upon UFO sightings dataset that will allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time, such as city, state, country, and shape etc.  We will be utilizing JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js to create our webpage.

## Results:
Multiple selection:
* by City

* by State

## Summary: 
We have created a clean page to allow the user to filter through the different sitings in our dataset using the search bars created. 

Drawback: The filter can only look at one id at a time. For example, people can't select 2 states at the same time.

My recommendations: 
- A drop-down menu where you can select multiple criteria would improve the situation.
- We can also improve the user experenice by including the ability to sort the table by more recent or least recent.
